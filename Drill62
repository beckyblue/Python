'''
Using Python version 2.7
Title: Datetime
Scenario: The company you work for just opened two new branches. One is in New York City,
the other in London. They need a very simple program to find out if the branches are open or
closed based on the current time of the Headquarters here in Portland. The hours of both
branches are 9:00AM - 9:00PM in their own time zone.
What is asked of you:
Create code that will use the current time of the Portland HQ to find out the time in the NYC &
London branches, then compare that time with the branches hours to see if they are open or
closed.

from datetime import *

ldnHour = ldnTime.hour
nycHour = nycTime.hour

openTime = 9

if ldnHour >= openTime and ldnHour < closeTime:
    print 'The London branch is currently OPEN.'
else:
    print 'The London branch is currently CLOSED.'

if nycHour >= openTime and nycHour < closeTime:
    print 'The New York branch is currently OPEN.'

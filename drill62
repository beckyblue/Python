'''
Using Python version 2.7
Title: Datetime
Scenario: The company you work for just opened two new branches. One is in New York City,
the other in London. They need a very simple program to find out if the branches are open or
closed based on the current time of the Headquarters here in Portland. The hours of both
branches are 9:00AM - 9:00PM in their own time zone.
What is asked of you:
Create code that will use the current time of the Portland HQ to find out the time in the NYC &
London branches, then compare that time with the branches hours to see if they are open or
closed.

print 'New York City current time is: ' + str(nycHours)+':'+ minutes +'. The branch is ' + nycOpen + '.'
print 'London current time is: ' + str(ldnHours)+':'+ minutes +'. The branch is ' + ldnOpen + '.'

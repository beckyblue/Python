'''
Using Python version 2.7
Title: Daily File Transfer

Scenario: Your company's users create or edit a collection of text files
throughout the day. These text files represent data about customer
orders.

Once per day, any files that are new, or that were edited within the
previous 24 hours, must be sent to the home office.

To facilitate this,these new or updated files need to be copied to a
specific 'destination'folder on a computer, so that a special file transfer
program can grab them and transfer them to the home office.
